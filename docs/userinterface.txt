TOPSECRET – Command Line Interface (Team Member A)

Purpose

* Provide a command-line utility to list available mission data files, and display a selected file’s contents.
* Program is executed from the class `TopSecret` using:
  java topsecret

Supported Commands

1. List files (no arguments)
   Command:
   java topsecret

   Behavior:

   * Lists the numbered files available to display.
   * Each file is shown on its own line.
   * Format:
     NN filename
     where NN is a 2-digit number starting at 01.

   Example output:
   01 filea.txt
   02 fileb.txt
   03 filec.txt

   Exit:

   * Program exits immediately after printing the list.

2. Display a file (one argument)
   Command:
   java topsecret <NN>

   Parameters:

   * <NN> is the 2-digit file selection number shown in the list (e.g., 01, 02, 03).
   * The program prints the contents of the corresponding file to standard output.

   Example:
   java topsecret 01
   Output:
   (contents of the file mapped to 01)

   Exit:

   * Program exits immediately after printing the file contents.

3. Display a file with alternate cipher key (two arguments)
   Command:
   java topsecret <NN> <KEY>

   Parameters:

   * <NN> is the 2-digit file selection number.
   * <KEY> is an alternate key source used for deciphering.
     NOTE: This option must exist even if the group is using plain text files.
     Interpretation of <KEY> (chosen by Team C/D to implement):

     * Either a filename (e.g., key2.txt) or a key identifier string
     * Must be documented/accepted consistently by implementation

   Behavior:

   * Program attempts to load/use the alternate key for deciphering instead of the default key.
   * Then prints the displayed file contents (deciphered if necessary).

   Exit:

   * Program exits immediately after printing the file contents or after printing an error message.

Input Validation Rules

* Argument count:

  * 0 args: list files
  * 1 arg: display file
  * 2 args: display file using alternate key
  * Any other count: error

* File selection format (<NN>):

  * Must be exactly two digits: "01", "02", ...
  * If not two digits or not numeric: error

* File selection existence:

  * If <NN> does not match any available file number: error

Error Handling + Exit Behavior.

* All errors should print a clear message to standard output or standard error (implementation choice, but be consistent).
* After printing an error message, the program exits gracefully (no stack trace).

Required error cases:

1. Invalid number of arguments.
   Example:
   java topsecret 01 extra tooMany
   Output (suggested):
   ERROR: Invalid arguments.
   Usage: java topsecret [NN] [KEY]

2. Invalid selection format
   Example:
   java topsecret 1
   Output (suggested):
   ERROR: File selection must be two digits (e.g., 01).

3. Selection not found / no mapping
   Example:
   java topsecret 99
   Output (suggested):
   ERROR: No file found for selection 99.

4. File read failure (missing/unreadable)
   Output (suggested):
   ERROR: Unable to read requested file.

5. Cipher/key problems (if ciphered teams)
   Output (suggested):
   ERROR: Unable to decipher file with provided key.

Notes for Team Integration

* Team B will provide the actual list of files (names + ordering) from /data.
* Team C will map the numbering scheme (01..NN) to the returned file list.
* Team D (if applicable) will implement deciphering; the CLI only defines how the key is supplied.
