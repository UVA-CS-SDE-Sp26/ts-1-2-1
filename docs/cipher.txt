Top Secret - Cipher (Member D)

Purpose:
    -Given a ciphered string, return the deciphered version

UML:
-key: HashMap<Character, Character>
-actualLetters: String
-cipherMatch: String
-------------------------------
-createKeySet()
+decipher()

Requirements to use:
    - needs method to read txt files and convert to strings
    - when cipher is accessed, it must be validated
    - must work even when incomplete ciphers are used
    - must be generalized to work with any cipher and ciphered strings

Pseudo Code for decipher method:

Create an empty string where you store characters and will eventually return
First loop through each individual character in the cipher key
    Place the character into key(the hashmap), with the key being the ciphered character
    and the value being the deciphered character
Then Loop through the string to be deciphered
    if the set contains the character
        add to the new string the value at that key
    otherwise
        just add what the original character was
return the new created string

Test Cases:

1. given key.txt and the ciphered string "eph", should return "dog"
2. given any string and an empty cipher, should return the original string
3. given the cipher of key.txt and a ciphered string "eph." should return "dog."
4. given a ciphered string that is the first line of key.txt, return the 2nd line of key.txt
